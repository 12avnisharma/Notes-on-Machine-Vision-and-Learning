Event-Based 3D Motion Flow Estimation Using 4D Spatio Temporal Subspaces Properties - R. Benosman (http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2016.00596/full)

Objective: A new solution to estimate scene flow using properties of 4D(3D space + time) spaces without the need to use luminance.

Scene flow are vector fields that map points of a 3d structure to their instantaneous velocity vectors. Because of this close 
relationship, estimating the scene flow usually implies to estimating the structure and vice-versa. 
Dense scene flow estimation - state-of-the-art techniques estimate depth maps and compute optical flows of each camera separately. 
In a second stage they combine both to estimate the 3D flow.
